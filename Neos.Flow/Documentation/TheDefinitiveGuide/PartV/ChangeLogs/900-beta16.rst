`!!! FEATURE: Dispatcher psr overhaul <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3311>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To ease the implementation of a custom controller now use a direct pattern of ``f(ActionRequest) => PsrResponseInterface``.
This is breaking if you implemented your own ``ControllerInterface`` or overwrote low level parts and methods of the ``ActionController``.


```php
class Dispatcher
{
    public function dispatch(ActionRequest $request): ResponseInterface;
}

interface ControllerInterface
{
    public function processRequest(ActionRequest $request): ResponseInterface;
}
```

Also, it's discouraged to manipulate ``$this->response`` in controllers (the ``ActionResponse`` is deprecated), although it's still supported in actions for now, please consider returning a new response instead.

<details>

<summary>
Explanation of the legacy MVC response object.
</summary>

Previously Flows MVC needed a single mutable response which was passed from dispatcher to controllers
and even further to the view and other places via the controller context: ``ControllerContext::getResponse()``.
This allowed to manipulate the response at every place.
With the dispatcher and controllers now directly returning a response, the mutability is no longer required.
Additionally, the abstraction offers naturally nothing, that cant be archived by the psr response,
as it directly translates to one: ``ActionResponse::buildHttpResponse()``
So you can and should use the immutable psr {@see ResponseInterface} instead where-ever possible.
For backwards compatibility, each controller will might now manage an own instance of the action response
via ``$this->response`` ``AbstractController::$response`` and pass it along to places.
But this behaviour is deprecated!
Instead, you can directly return a PSR repose ``\\GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Response`` from a controller:

```php
public function myAction()
{
    return (new Response(status: 200, body: $output))
        ->withAddedHeader('X-My-Header', 'foo');
}
```

</details>

Further the ``ForwardException`` does not extend the ``StopActionException`` anymore, meaning a try catch must be adjusted.

`!!! FEATURE: update to `doctrine/dbal` version 3 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2637>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

update to doctrine/dbal version 3

* doctrines json_array type is deprecated, therefore flow_json_array is based off of json type now
* We use PSR6 caches now instead of the deprecated doctrine cache implementation 
* New Cache ``Flow_Persistence_Doctrine_Metadata`` for ORM class metadata
* ``Repository::findAllIterator`` directly returns an iterable, the ``Repository::iterate`` method is gone
* All doctrine migration commands have a new optional ``migration-folder`` argument that allows to overwrite the "platform name part" in migration resolving (e.g. "Mysql") as the resolving changed and we cannot be sure deducing it from the current connection will work long term for all cases. Currently MySQL/MariaDB (map to "Mysql"), PostgreSQL (maps to "Postgresql" and SQLite (maps to "Sqlite") all work fine automatically still.

`!!! FEATURE: `ViewInterface` returns PSR `StreamInterface` <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3286>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neos adjustments https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/4856

- the views are now independent of the ``ControllerContext``
  - ``ViewInterface::setControllerContext`` is not part of the interface anymore and will only be called on demand
- the ``ActionRequest`` if necessary can be accessed via the variable "request" (like "settings")
- ``ViewInterface::canRender`` was required for fallbackviews which have been removed long ago, and so this artefact will be removed as well.
- !!! the return type is now forced to be either a ``ResponseInterface`` or a ``StreamInterface``. Simple strings must be wrapped in a psr stream! (see ``StreamFactoryTrait::createStream``)

`!!! FEATURE: WIP Dispatcher and controller return `ActionResponse` (simpler controller pattern) <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3232>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

will not be merged directly into 9.0 but included in this mvc overhaul pr: https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3311


This change needs an accompanying adjustment to Neos to adjust the
PluginImplementation as well as Modules.

~The new ``SimpleActionController`` gives you a direct and simple way to
route an ActionRequest and return an ActionReponse with nothing in
between. Routing should work just like with other ActionControllers.~

This is breaking if you implemented your own ControllerInterface
or overwrote or expect some of the api methods of the ActionController.
We now use a direct pattern of f(ActionRequest) => ActionResponse
in more places. Adjusting existing controllers should be easy though.
Additionally implementing your own dispatch loop (don't do this) will
need adjustments.

We discourage to manipulate ``$this->reponse`` in controllers,
although it should still work fine in actions for now, please consider
other options.

```php
class Dispatcher
{
    public function dispatch(ActionRequest $request): ActionResponse;

`FEATURE: Introduce --help flag option for existing CLI commands <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3367>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Upgrade instructions**

_None_

**Review instructions**

This change introduces a new way of using the help function for existing Flow/Neos CLI commands.

Currently you always used:

```bash
./flow help user:create
```

With this change it is possible to use the new ``--help`` flag as an alternative at **the end** of a CLI command:

```bash
./flow user:create --help
```

But of course the first way will also still work!

`FEATURE: Introduce EEL tracer for handling Neos9 deprecations <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3386>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Related https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/5022

In todays weekly @bwaidelich and me discussed a concrete way how to log deprecations like ``node.indentifier`` in Neos 8.4 and 9.0

The idea is to add a tracer to eel, that will be implemented in Fusion. Technically we would need to add an abstraction to Neos.Fusion as well to not access the Node from there as this is architecturally illegal but to simplify the code and in light that this is just considered for temporary time we propose to implement it as such:

```php
<?php

namespace Neos\\Fusion\\Core;

use Neos\\Flow\\Annotations as Flow;
use Psr\\Log\\LoggerInterface;

final class Neos9RuntimeMigrationTracer implements EelInvocationTracerInterface
{
    /** @Flow\\Inject */
    protected LoggerInterface $logger;

    private const DEPRECATED_NODE_PROPERTIES = [
        'identifier' => true,
        'nodetype' => true,
        // ...
    ];

    public function __construct(
        private readonly string $eelExpression,
        private readonly bool $showMercy
    ) {
    }

    public function recordPropertyAccess(object $object, string $propertyName): void
    {
        if (
            $object instanceof \\Neos\\ContentRepository\\Domain\\Model\\Node
            && array_key_exists(strtolower($propertyName), self::DEPRECATED_NODE_PROPERTIES)
        ) {
            $this->logDeprecationOrThrowException(
                sprintf('"node.%s" is deprecated in "%s"', $propertyName, $this->eelExpression)
            );
        }
    }

    public function recordMethodCall(object $object, string $methodName): void
    {
    }

    private function logDeprecationOrThrowException(string $message): void
    {
        if ($this->showMercy) {
            $this->logger->debug($message);
        } else {
            throw new \\RuntimeException($message);
        }
    }
}
```


and instantiate this ``Neos9RuntimeMigrationTracer`` (name tbd) in ``\\Neos\\Fusion\\Core\\Runtime::evaluateEelExpression``

```diff
- return EelUtility::evaluateEelExpression($expression, $this->eelEvaluator, $contextVariables);
+ $tracer =.$this->settings['enableDeprecationTracer'] ? new Neos9RuntimeMigrationTracer($expression, $this->settings['strictEelMode'] ?? false) : null;
+ return EelUtility::evaluateEelExpression($expression, $this->eelEvaluator, $contextVariables, $tracer);

`FEATURE: Support doctrine/dbal 2.x and 3.x <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3377>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Declares compatibility with ``doctrine/dbal`` 3.x (in addition to the already supported versions ``2.13+``) and adjusts affected code such that it works with both versions

**Upgrade instructions**

Any code that (heavily) uses Doctrine DBAL specifics should be checked for compatibility issues. Even if things still work, you may want to replace things deprecated in Doctrine DBAL 3. See https://www.doctrine-project.org/2020/11/17/dbal-3.0.0.html

One example: You need to replace, as the ``json_array`` type is removed in Doctrine DBAL 3.0.
```php
@ORM\\Column(type="json_array", nullable=true)
```
with
```php
@ORM\\Column(type="flow_json_array", nullable=true)
```

**Review instructions**

We allow now version 3 of ``doctrine/dbal`` but still only support ``doctrine/orm`` in version 2.

By default, the ``PositionalArraySorter`` removes all ``null`` values. This change makes this behavior an _option_ that can be passed to the constructor:

```php

(new PositionalArraySorter(['foo' => null], removeNullValues: false))->toArray(); // ['foo']

`FEATURE: Add `Flow\InjectCache` Attribute / Annotation for property injection <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3244>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In many cases an ``Objects.yaml`` is created just to inject caches which can feel a bit cumbersome as one already had specified the cache in ``Caches.yaml``.

To address this the new ``@Flow\\InjectCache`` annotation allows to assign a cache frontend of a configured cache directly to a property without having to configure the ``Objects.yaml`` at all.

```php
    #[Flow\\InjectCache(identifier: 'Flow_Mvc_Routing_Resolve')]

`FEATURE: introduce `UriHelper` to work with query parameters <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3316>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FYI: This pr was refactored again via https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3336

While working on https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2744 and also https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/4552 we always came to the conclusion that the ``$queryParameters`` merging of the psr uri is limited.

This introduces a utility to do this:


```php
UriHelper::uriWithAdditionalQueryParameters($this->someUriBuilder->uriFor(...), ['q' => 'search term']);
```

and allows us to remove any $queryParam logic from the uribuilder(s)

`FEATURE: Add `Flow\Route` Attribute/Annotation <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3325>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``Flow\\Route`` attribute allows to define routes directly on the affected method. This allows to avoid dealing with Routes.yaml in projects in simple cases where is sometimes is annoying to look up the exact syntax for that.

Usage:

```php
use Neos\\Flow\\Mvc\\Controller\\ActionController;
use Neos\\Flow\\Annotations as Flow;

class ExampleController extends ActionController
{
    #[Flow\\Route(uriPattern:'my/path', httpMethods: ['GET'])]
    public function someAction(): void
    {
    }

    #[Flow\\Route(uriPattern:'my/other/b-path', defaults: ['test' => 'b'])]
    #[Flow\\Route(uriPattern:'my/other/c-path', defaults: ['test' => 'c'])]
    public function otherAction(string $test): void
    {
    }
}
```

To use annotation routes packages have to register the ``AttributeRoutesProviderFactory`` in ``Neos.Flow.mvc.routes`` with Controller classNames or patterns.

Settings.yaml:
```yaml
Neos:
  Flow:
    mvc:
      routes:
        Vendor.Example.attributes:
          position: 'before Neos.Neos'
          providerFactory: \\Neos\\Flow\\Mvc\\Routing\\AttributeRoutesProviderFactory
          providerOptions:
            classNames:
              - Vendor\\Example\\Controller\\ExampleController
```

This pr also adds the general option to register ``provider`` and ``providerOptions`` in  the Setting ``Neos.Flow.mvc.routes`` which was required obviously.

The package: ``WebSupply.RouteAnnotation`` by @sorenmalling implemented similar ideas earlier.

`FEATURE: Separate RouteConfiguration from Router <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2970>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This separates the Routes configuration from the router by introducing a ``RoutesProviderInterface`` which will be used by the router implementation together with a ``ConfigurationRoutesProvider`` that implements the current configuration from Routes.yaml. 

Switching out the internal implementation of the ``RoutesProviderInterface`` can be done via Objects.yaml to add custom behaviour. But be aware that this is not covered by our api promises. All Implementations should include the routes provided by the ``ConfigurationRoutesProvider``.

This change also makes sure, that the RouteCommandController uses the current ``RoutesProviderInterface`` implementation, instead of hard coded Flow router. That ensures that all Routes available to the router are now also visible to route cli-commands.

* Fixes: `#2948 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/2948>`_

**Upgrade instructions**

This change removes the methods ``getRoutes`` and ``addRoute`` from the Router that previously were mainly used in functional-tests as they were never part of the Router Interface. 

To adjust for that the existing utility ``FunctionalTestCase->registerRoute`` method has to be used instead of ``FunctionalTestCase->router->addRoute``.

The method ``Router::setRoutesConfiguration``, which was also previously used for internal testing has been removed without official replacement. You _could_ technically inject a custom routes provider to do so but be aware that this is internal behaviour.

**Review instructions**

Run the ./flow routing:list command - you will see the list as expected

`FEATURE: Add more information for object arguments in debugging <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3211>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For stacktraces in exceptions and logs we now render some representation of content for objects to ease debugging with DTOs.

Specifically we will try to obtain a string representation for such an object by using either in this order:

- a string cast if __toString() is available
- json_encode if it is JsonSerializable
- json_encode on the array of public properties

For readability json_encode will be limited to the first level, also all of those string representations will be cut off after 100 characters.

If any of those options works we will also shorten the className to avoid this output becoming overly long.

Note that we use JSON_PARTIAL_OUTPUT_ON_ERROR to make sure some output is provided. This might lead to partial or weird outputs depending on the object structure, but might still provide pointers for debugging.

`FEATURE: Add `getAccessorByPath` to `Neos\Utility\Arrays` for type safe accessing of array values <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3149>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_**Please note that this is an experimental feature and the API is not stable yet.**_

The array utility allows to create a type safe accessor via ``Arrays::getAccessorByPath($arrayValue, 'your.path')``. The accessor provides the following methods that will either return the requested type or throw a ``\\UnexpectedValueException``.  

* ``int(): int``
* ``float(): float``
* ``number(): int|float``
* ``string(): string``
* ``classString(): string`` - with annotation for class-string
* ``array(): array``
* ``instanceOf(string $className): object`` - with annotation for dynamic type
* ``intOrNull(): ?int``
* ``floatOrNull(): ?float``
* ``numberOrNull(): null|int|float``
* ``stringOrNull(): ?string``
* ``classStringOrNull(): ?string`` - with annotation for class-string | null
* ``arrayOrNull(): ?array``
* ``instanceOfOrNull(string $className): ?object`` - with annotation for dynamic type | null

This will allow to write code that accesses settings via pathes without checking every level for existence still beeing type safe and accessible for static analysis.

This can be used together with settingInjection.

```php
public function injectSettings(array $settings): void
{
   $this->limit = Arrays::getAccessorByPath($settings, 'limit')->intOrNull();
}
```

**Review instructions**

It may look inefficient to manually throw TypeErrors that in many cases would be thrown automatically because of the declared return types. However this is not a performance issue as those are never on the happy-path and the created TypeError provides additional informations to help understand and fix problems faster.

`FEATURE: Exclude classes from constructor autowiring <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3070>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Classes can now explicitly be excluded from constructor autowiring through a new setting.

The setting accepts an array of fully qualified class names, each class name being a regular expression. Classes of scope prototype which expect objects to be passed to their constructor are usually considered for autowiring which results in a proxy class being generated.

This option allows to exclude classes from this process. This is useful for classes like data transfer objects, read models, commands, events and value objects which usually don't rely on dependency injection.

Flow cannot reliably detect weather a prototype class depends on autowiring for constructor arguments or not. Use this option to optimize your application to avoid the small but measurable overhead of proxy generation for those kinds of classes.

Note that if there are other reasons than constructor injection which require a proxy class to be generated, the proxy class will be generated no matter what.

This change partly reverts `#3050 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/3050>`_because now proxy classes _are_ generated for prototype classes by default. Otherwise a lot of existing Flow applications would not work correctly anymore.

`FEATURE: Support private constructors in proxy classes <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3072>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flow now can correctly build proxy classes for classes with private constructors. Previously, such classes caused errors and proxy class building had to be disabled with the ``Proxy(false)`` annotation. Now classes with private constructors can take advantage of setter and property injection and are considered for advices through the AOP framework.

`!!!BUGFIX: Make any exception handable in renderingGroups by statusCode <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1514>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before only exceptions that derive from FlowException could be handled with renderingGroups. This sets the status code for unknown exceptions to 500, so they will match a ``matchingStatusCodes`` configuration.
Therefore a configuration like this will now also render generic exceptions as if they were FlowExceptions with a status code of 500:
```yaml
Neos:
  Flow:
    error:
      exceptionHandler:
        renderingGroups:

          'allExceptions':
            matchingStatusCodes: [500]
            options:
              templatePathAndFilename: 'some-path'
```

Note: This is slightly breaking if you handled Flow Exceptions differently than generic exceptions. If you do want to render Flow exceptions differently then generic exceptions, the way to do this is:

```yaml
Neos:
  Flow:
    error:
      exceptionHandler:
        renderingGroups:

          'flowExceptions':
            matchingExceptionClassNames: ['FlowException']
            options:
              templatePathAndFilename: 'some-path'

`BUGFIX: Make debugger more robust <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3388>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prevent exception inception while trying to render debug outputs.

This can happen when complex objects are encountered in stacktraces and we try to render a string representation. Example would be ``LazyProps`` in Fusion which can easily throw while evaluating. This is especially nasty as it leads to recursions if the original error being rendered occurred while trying to render this same LazyProps object, thus triggering the error handling again.

The suggested fix covers the whole argument rendering in a try/catch block, as this makes the code even more unreadable it was refactored to separate methods.

`BUGFIX: Replacement proxy methods rendered again <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3101>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fixes a bug introduced in d939e6b8 switching to laminuas-code. A proxy method can replace the full body of an existing method or even be a fully new method, in which case only ``body`` will be set in the proxy method. We still want those to be generated. This for example currently breaks the CompileStatic feature, as those methods do not get rendered anymore resulting in worse performance in Production context compared to before.

This fix renders a proxy method also when a body was set for it, but still skips it if neither pre/post nor body is set.

It also enabled CompileStatic in Testing Context so that it is testable and adds a test to make sure it works as intended.

That way, Flow will not build useless proxies for typical read models which expect a mix of objects and straight values in their constructor.

> I will dig a bit into history as I guess something (that obviously no one cares about) was lost in the PSR HTTP refactoring. I think (as we can see in the dispatch loop) there was a possibility before for a controller to gain control but decide it does not finally dispatch the request and thus the dispatch loop would continue and try to find another controller to take care, so it was the controllers responsibility to set this, but I am not sure what conditions it previously attached to it being dispatched.

`!!! TASK: `Mvc\Dispatcher::afterControllerInvocation` will not be called for CLI requests anymore. <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3296>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reverts that the cli dispatcher invokes the mvc slots dispatcher slots with cli requests.

When there was one dispatcher the slot ``afterControllerInvocation`` was fired for both cli and web request. (Seemingly only ever at Runtime?)

Then with the split of web and cli dispatchers this legacy layer was introduced:

https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/`cf55b180c953de8d02adb680216f5c24a3524237 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/cf55b180c953de8d02adb680216f5c24a3524237>``_#diff-``2c9408e74a8ac737f84468e74c23956d2057e641 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/2c9408e74a8ac737f84468e74c23956d2057e641>`_96e66b97281905d8697226ca

Now during a short time the ``Mvc\\Dispatcher::afterControllerInvocation`` signal was now also called for cli request during compile time.

With this bugfix https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2529 the initial behaviour was restored again. For cli request it will only fire at runtime, and web request are either way always runtime.

This breaking change cleans up the legacy layer.

- The original signals ``Mvc\\Dispatcher`` ``'afterControllerInvocation'`` and ``'beforeControllerInvocation'``
  Will be only invoked for action requests.
They still only fire at runtime, as web requests happen at runtime.

- The with Flow 6.0 introduced signals ``Cli\\Dispatcher`` ``'afterControllerInvocation'`` and ``'beforeControllerInvocation'``
  Will still be only invoked for cli requests.
Will still fired either at compile or runtime, as cli requests can happen always.

**Upgrade instructions**

In case you used the MVC signals and relied on it to also be invoked for CliRequest, you need to connect as well to the respective Cli\\Dispatcher signal. But keep in mind that you might need to check if flow is in runtime as this signal will be also fired for compile time unlike the mvc signal before.

**Upgrade instructions**

The following methods were removed from the ``UriHelper`` as they are obsolete and not used.
Its unlikely that the functionality is known and simple to implement yourself.
- ``\\Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Helper\\UriHelper::getUsername``
- ``\\Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Helper\\UriHelper::getPassword``
- ``\\Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Helper\\UriHelper::parseQueryIntoArguments``

The method ``\\Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Helper\\UriHelper::uriWithArguments`` was renamed to ``\\Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Helper\\UriHelper::uriWithQueryParameters`` to distinct between route values and query parameters which are not the same.
Also it will encode the query parameters after `PHP_QUERY_RFC1738 <https://www.php.net/manual/de/url.constants.php#constant.php-query-rfc1738>`_.

**Review instructions**

The pr `#3316 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/3316>`_introduced a new uri helper while we already had one actually. This pr combines the two and cleans things up.

To ensure the logic of ``uriWithAdditionalQueryParameters`` is not duplicated and possibly handled elsewhere differently the helper is now also used internally by the uriConstraints.

Also the method has been renamed to better fit the previous sibling ``uriWithArguments``.

The removed methods are dead code and previously introduced once with Flow 5.1: https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/`85408589462b7530180d3dce2858500f29f94bbe <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/85408589462b7530180d3dce2858500f29f94bbe>`_
As part of replacements for the old (now removed) flow Uri implementation:

``Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Uri::getUsername`` -> ``\\Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Helper\\UriHelper::getUsername``
``Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Uri::getPassword`` -> ``\\Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Helper\\UriHelper::getPassword``
``Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Uri::getArguments`` -> ``\\Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Helper\\UriHelper::parseQueryIntoArguments``

So maybe these methods _are_ known in fact and it would be a bit mean to remove them just because i felt like it and we dont use / test them?

`!!! TASK: Introduce `TargetInterface::onPublish` callback <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3229>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently every implementation of the ``TargetInterface::publishCollection`` should declare a second parameter: ``callable $callback = null`` which not part of the interface, but used by convention. This pattern causes trouble when using phpstan and also it’s not best practice. To improve this code and preserve the usecase partially the interface now allows to register ``onPublish`` callbacks, which should be called when ``publishCollection`` is run:

```php
interface TargetInterface
{
     // ...

     /**
      * @param \\Closure(int $iteration): void $callback Function called after each resource publishing
      */
     public function onPublish(\\Closure $callback): void;
}
```

**Upgrade instructions**

In case you are using the callback, you need to adjust the calling side:

```diff
- $fileSystemTarget->publishCollection($staticCollection, $myPublicationCallback);
+ $fileSystemTarget->onPublish($myPublicationCallback);
+ $fileSystemTarget->publishCollection($staticCollection);
```

Also note that the second parameter ``$object`` will not be passed anymore. The callback only contains the ``$iteration`` as one and only parameter.

Additionally the method ``iterate(…)`` in the ``ResourceRepository`` has been removed, replace it by iterating over the result of ``findAllIterator()`` directly.

The usage and retrieval ``BaseTestCase::getAccessibleMock()`` has been deprecated as one should not use this for testing. It will lead to a super high coupling of the tests to the super internal implementation which makes refactoring basically impossible (without rewriting major parts of the tests).

    - or just take the code 1 to 1
- the naming ``ValueAccessor`` vs ``Extractor``
- ``Arrays::getAccessorByPath($array, 'path.bar')->int()`` vs ``ValueAccessor::for($array)['path']['bar']->int()``
    - im not sure about if we want to propagate the dot access pattern forever ;)

`TASK: Refactor and optimize of session data storage <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3254>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before the SessionMetadata and SessionData was written with every request which caused network traffic, storage wear and also made race conditions much more likely when parallel requests changed session data. 

In total this can reduce the number of write operations on the Session caches by 80-90% removing storage and network load as those caches always are persistent and shared across clusters.

1. The improvements are on top of the Neos 9 already reducing the Flow_Session_Storage write load by not always storing the "lastVisitedNode" in the session.
2. The improvements mostly occur after sending the result "onShutdown" so this will not improve single requests but overall performance and number of parallel requests.

### Problem 

The session metadata (SessionId, StorageId, LastActivity .. ) is usually written at shutdown of every single request to the session metadata cache even when nothing changed. 

### Optimization 

This is optimized by the new setting ``Neos.Flow.session.updateMetadataThreshold`` that allows to configure the interval for updating the session metadata when nothing but the ``lastActivityTimestamp`` has changed. This removes lots of cache writes and avoids network traffic or storage wear. The session metadata is also converted to a single value object that combines SessionID, StorageID and lastActivityTimestamp.

## 2. SessionKeyValueStore / Flow_Session_Storage: 

### Problem

Session data is written to the Flow_Session_Storage cache once Session->putData is called. In case of flow this mostly is the Objects of scope ``@Flow\\Scope("session")`` that are stored on shutdown. Those objects are sometimes modified but during most requests nothing changes here and at the end of the request the same data is added to the cache again with another redundant cache write. 

### Optimization

The SessionDataStore optimizes this be keeping a hash of the value all previously read keys and avoids writes if the serialized content that is stored yields the same hash. That way only once session-data was actually changed the session objects are actually written to the cache. This also lessens the probability of some race conditions drastically that can occur when multiple parallel requests work on the same session.

The following redundant behavior was also removed:
- All session metadata records in the cache were previously tagged with ``session`` for iterating over them again. This is replaced by the ``retrieveAll`` method.
- The current authentication providers were always stored in the session data as ``Neos_Flow_Security_Accounts `` but were unused  
- Do we want to release this as 8.4 or 9.0? In case of 9.0 the SessionMetaData ValueObject will be adjusted to php 8.1 style.

**Review instructions**

Some questions during the review could be:
- Are there better ways to determine written objects are modified than comparing hashes of serialized values?: I did not find one.
- Should the comparison of written data with hashes of existing data be implemented in the cache frontend instead?: I think this would consume to much memory we have lots of cache items.

`TASK: `resource:clean` followup #1678 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3275>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While reading the code, looking for improvement, it seems tedious that we ``getIdentifierByObject`` just to ``findByIdentifier`` a few lines later.

This happened due to a funny history of back and forth.

At first - 2014 - ``resource:clean`` was introduced looping over the PersistentResource: https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/`8a1ce0fba6cb0bf301f971a6d7d5675e0c038d75 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/8a1ce0fba6cb0bf301f971a6d7d5675e0c038d75>`_

Then - 2016 - it was decided to save the sha1 and loop over them and retrieve the asset via ``findOneBySha1``: https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/`879fba19f93d0a8628682698e57da9f1b58ad7d4 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/879fba19f93d0a8628682698e57da9f1b58ad7d4>`_

But that did not improve the situation as described in https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1678 and was removed again - 2019.

So in functionality we made a full round, im just here to followup on the last fix to restore the full state syntactically as it was once though of.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I ran phpstan level 3 once on flow. And it seems we dont specifiy the nullable types correctly, but we document them in the doc string.
So i wrote a little helping script that would add the ``|null`` php doc annotation to all ``@param`` and ``@return`` types if we specify ``or NULL`` in the message. I carefully reviewed every change and made additionally some manual changes and corrected things. This is completely non breaking as only doc comments are being touched.

This will help for migrating to phpstan level 3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This removed the code that set ``Flow_Persistence_clone`` in entities or value objects when they were ``clone``d.

As dynamic properties are deprecated with PHP 8.2, this caused warnings and will eventually break.

Since this was (re)-introduced in Flow 2 via `90cb65827c1550e9144e9f83b9231b430c106660 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/90cb65827c1550e9144e9f83b9231b430c106660>``_ to support custom backends in the geenric persistence layer of Flow, like the (now outdated) ``TYPO3.CouchDB`, we felt it is best to remove it.

**Upgrade instructions**

If you rely on this, you need to adjust your code. Chances are, if you still need this, you use the generic peristsnece layer, which is gone in Flow 7 aready (see https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1769 and https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2262). So, you have other problems to solve, anyway…

`TASK: Only add serialization entities code if needed <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3047>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proxy classes created by the Dependency Injection Proxy Class Builder now only contain code related to serialization and deserialization of related entities if needed.

The code is only rendered if one of the following conditions is met:

- The class is annotated with Entity
- The class is annotated with Scope("session")

Despite the previous condition, the code will not be rendered if the following condition is true:

- The class already has a __sleep() method (we assume that the developer wants to take care of serialization themself)

As part of this change, the generated code related to serialization was slightly adjusted for stricter type handling.

related: `#1539 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/1539>`_

**Review instructions**

- try to find an existing application which relies on serialization of related entities, for example a Flow application which uses ORM with relations or uses entities in a session scope.
- remove all caches and then access your application in a browser using the current Flow 9 branch (without this patch)
- create a backup of the Cache/Code/Flow_Object_Classes directory
- switch to a branch with this change, remove all caches and access the application again in a browser
- use a diff tool (e.g. Kaleidoscope) to compare both cache directories to see what is now different
- check if your application still works
